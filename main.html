          <h2>Stuff</h2>
          <p>
            Out of the parking lot, take your first left. While it has no real technical features to speak of since
            being redesigned, it is a lot of fun to ride this glassy smooth and generally well-bermed trail.
            Fast and flowing with big jump options and some pretty crazy gap jumps. You can ride around everything,
             which will give you a chance to look before you leap. Lots of Flow!<br /><br />

            Or with only moderate climbing involved these trails can keep almost anyone interested for hours.
            3. This new trail flows well and has multiple banked berms and small jumps that wind down
            the mountainside. An awesome descent, with some high speed ripping at the top, some root drops
            in the middle, and some great bank turns at the bottom. Fun and all down when coming off the top.

        <h2>More Stuff</h2>
        <p>
          6 mile thrill ride through the dense pine forest of the park. Even though it is a short trail
           it is extremely fun to ride. MBoSC has partnered with land manager California Department of
           Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) to build a four mile flow trail in Soquel Demonstration
           State Forest (SDSF). Built specifically for mountain bikes, a flow trail emphasizes speed and rhythm,
            featuring berms, rollers, jumps and other features that are designed in a way that uses the riderâ€™s
            momentum to minimize pedaling and braking (think downhill pump track). Great trail, with amazing views,
            but may see a lot of traffic.
